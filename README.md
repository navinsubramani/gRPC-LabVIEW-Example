# gRPC-LabVIEW-Example
This repository contains the examples to demonstrate the gRPC LabVIEW capability and gRPC use cases. It is initially made for the GLA summit 2021.

# Software Requirement
LabVIEW 2019 64-bit or later

gRPC LabVIEW support from : https://github.com/ni/grpc-labview/releases

BloomRPC is a good client tool to control the service using the proto file: https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc/releases

Visual Studio Code for Python

# Development Tutorial: 

LabVIEW service and client is created using this: https://github.com/navinsubramani/grpc-labview/releases and instruction: https://github.com/navinsubramani/grpc-labview/blob/master/docs/ServerCreation.md

Python service and client is created using this: https://www.semantics3.com/blog/a-simplified-guide-to-grpc-in-python-6c4e25f0c506/

# Example 1 : Noise Waveform and PS Density

This example program demonstrates how a simple LabVIEW service can be controlled by a LabVIEW client and python client (and BloomRPC) in parallel.
