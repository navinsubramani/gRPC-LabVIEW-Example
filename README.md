# gRPC-LabVIEW-Example
This repository contains the examples to demonstrate the gRPC LabVIEW capability and gRPC use cases. It is initially made for the GLA summit 2021.

# Software Requirement
LabVIEW 2019 64-bit or later

gRPC LabVIEW support from : https://github.com/ni/grpc-labview/releases

BloomRPC is a good client tool to control the service using the proto file: https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc/releases

# Example 1 : Noise Waveform and PS Density

This example program demonstrates how a simple LabVIEW service can be controlled by a LabVIEW client and python client (and BloomRPC) in parallel.
